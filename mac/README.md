# OpenGL on Mac OS X
Some of my very first OpenGL programs, circa Nov 2019 (possibly earlier).

Ideas for future expansion:
	have a plane on which things bounce
	more complex models than just squares
		figure out how to import models from somewhere else
	figure out reflection
	backgrounds / lighting
		a night sky would be cool
	particle effects
		mist, fire, rain

Note: I deleted the glm library because it's large and needs to be stored somewhere else.
recover it by downloading it again and putting the "glm" folder in the current directory
